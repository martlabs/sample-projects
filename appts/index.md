The app, designed as a comprehensive platform for streamlining the employment process, features three distinct portals catering to applicants, employees, and administrators. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

   - **Appointment Booking:** Applicants can schedule appointments with employment specialists by completing a detailed questionnaire. This form gathers relevant information about their skills, experience, and job preferences, ensuring a tailored and efficient consultation.
   - **Virtual Call Setup:** Post questionnaire submission, applicants can choose a suitable time slot for a virtual call with a specialist. The app seamlessly integrates with popular video conferencing tools for convenience.
   - **Job Matching and Recommendations:** Based on the information provided, applicants receive personalized job recommendations and alerts for new openings.

2. **Employee (Employment Specialist) Portal:**

   - **Appointment Management:** Specialists can view and manage their appointment schedules, with details about each applicantâ€™s profile and questionnaire responses for preparation.
   - **Communication Tools:** The portal includes features for direct communication with applicants, allowing for pre-appointment queries and follow-ups.
   - **Resource Access:** Specialists have access to a database of job listings and company profiles to aid in providing accurate and up-to-date advice.

3. **Administrator Portal:**
   - **User Management:** Admins can oversee and manage the accounts of both applicants and employment specialists, ensuring smooth operation.
   - **Analytics and Reporting:** The portal offers detailed analytics on user engagement, appointment statistics, and success rates, aiding in strategic decision-making.
   - **System Customization and Updates:** Administrators can customize questionnaire forms, update job listings, and manage system-wide settings and updates.

Each portal is intuitively designed with user-friendly interfaces, ensuring ease of navigation and a streamlined experience. The app aims to bridge the gap between job seekers and employment opportunities, offering a personalized and efficient approach to career advancement.
